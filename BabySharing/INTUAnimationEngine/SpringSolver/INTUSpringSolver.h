 Creates and returns a reference to a new spring solver context, initialized with the given properties.

 @param damping         The amount of friction. Must be greater than or equal to zero. If exactly zero, the harmonic motion will continue
                        indefinitely (solver will never converge). Typical range: 1.0 to 30.0
 @param mass            The amount of mass being moved by the spring. Must be greater than zero. Typical range: 0.1 to 10.0
 @param initialPosition A vector representing the starting position of the mass attached to the spring. The spring always acts in the direction of the zero vector.
                        The vector must be an array of n double values, where n is the number of dimensions of the spring solver (kINTUSpringSolverDimensions).
